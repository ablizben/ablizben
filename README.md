# Hi there, I'm Abby 👩🏻‍💻

I'm a newbie developer who just recently graduated in a Full Stack Web Development boot camp through Trilogy & Johns Hopkins University based in the Baltimore area. I'm excited to dive deeper into my coding journey and looking forward to enjoying the ride. Personally, I'm a huge horror/slasher film nerd 👻 and channel my coding frustrations through boxing 🥊

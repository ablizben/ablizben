# Hi there, I'm Abby 👩🏻‍💻

I'm a newbie developer currently in a full stack Web Development boot camp through Trilogy & Johns Hopkins University based in the Baltimore area. I'm excited to dive deeper into my coding journey and looking forward to enjoying the ride. I'm interested in front-end development, specifically focusing on JavaScript with React. Personally, I'm a huge horror/slasher film nerd 👻 and channel my coding frustrations through boxing 🥊
